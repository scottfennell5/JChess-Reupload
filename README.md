# JChess Reupload

This project is a fork of an open-source Java-based chess game that I contributed to in Fall 2023 as part of my coursework. My primary goals were to improve the user experience and practice writing testable, maintainable code in a larger open-source codebase.

My contributions can be found in the following files:
Under src/main/java/com.chess/ui:
VisualPanel, MenuCompontent, and ChessBoardUI 
(warning, ChessBoardUI is large, my code can be found by searching for //Scott - BEGIN and //Scott - END)

Additionally, my test files can be found in test/java/com.chess/UI

## My Contributions
- Developed a **move visualization feature** to enhance interactivity.
- Implemented **unit tests** using **JUnit 4** for not only my code, but for existing code (as no tests existed in the original repository), with our group's total test coverage reaching 80%
- Gained experience navigating and understanding existing code, debugging, and extending functionality in Java.

## What I Learned
This was my first time contributing to an open-source project and working within a larger codebase I didn’t write from scratch. Some areas of the code—like exception handling—could definitely be improved, but the project helped me:
- Strengthen my understanding of Java and object-oriented design
- Practice version control and collaborative development
- Build confidence working through legacy code and adding features responsibly

## Notes
The code isn't perfect (especially regarding try/catch coverage), but it represents a significant step in my journey as a software engineer. I want to leave it public as a reflection of my growth and a foundation I plan to improve on.
